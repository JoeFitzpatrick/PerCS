Perceptually Congruent Sonification Web Guide

This web guide presents an accessible framework that can be used in conjunction with existing sonification strategies.

The framework links perceptual phenomena to sonification mapping strategies and provides a systematic approach to identifying and addressing these perceptually-driven problems in applied sonification. In addition to research materials, the web guide includes a number of audio-visual interactions that help explain various relevant auditory phenomena.
